                                <b> Javascript Design Patterns </b> Design patterns are <b>reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems</b> in software design. They are both exciting and a fascinating topic to explore in any programming language. Design patterns also provide us a <b>common vocabulary to describe solutions</b>. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution in code form to others. I have read a book on this , <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/" target="_blank">Find it here</a> .
